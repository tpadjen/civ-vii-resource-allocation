# TBQ's Resource Allocation Improvements

A mod to improve the Resources screen in Civ VII.

## Features:

- Remove all assigned resources from all settlements with the click of a button
- Autosort Settlements
    - Capital first, then cities, finally towns
    - Within a category (city or town) sort by
        - Larger resource capacity
        - Then alphabetically by localized city name
        - Razed settlements always come last in their group
- Keep all resource lists sorted too
- Middle click an assigned resource to immediately unassign it from a settlement, if possible
- Add a Show Cities toggle next to Show Towns
- Remove settlement type ('Capital', 'City', and 'Town') appended to name. There's already an icon

## Installation Instructions

## Known Issues

- Unassigning Resources
    - Camels are currently removed separately from other resources in a second pass during a mass unassignment because the engine refuses to remove them if there are still other resources filling the spots that were added to the city by the camel.
    - Unassigning a ton of resources may cause a short lag.
